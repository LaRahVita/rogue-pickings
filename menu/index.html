					<h2> Black-Eyed Pea Patties <span>Vegan</span> | $16 </h2>
					<p> Sweet and savory flavors mingle in this Southern-inspired dish. Mashed black-eyed peas are mixed with chia seeds (which serve as a nourishing, plant-based binder), breadcrumbs, a paprika-parsley spice blend, and a vegan Dijon aïoli, then formed into patties. Pan-seared to a crispy finish, they’re served over a bed of roasted potatoes and broccoli. A corn and roasted red pepper relish adds tangy notes on top.</p>
					<h2> Cauliflower and Kale Salad | $12 </h2>
					<p> This nourishing, veggie-packed salad will bring out your inner green goddess. Seasoned cauliflower is sautéed with pistachios and coated with honey for an irresistibly salty-sweet flavor combination. It’s all piled over a kale salad tossed with grape tomatoes, artichokes, carrots, and feta cheese. Toasted pita breads with garlic oil add a light crunch on the side. </p>
					<h2> Zucchini and Tomato Flatbread <span>Vegan</span> | $15 </h2>
					<p> Pizza night gets a unique and tasty reboot, using unexpected ingredients. Garlic-lemon tahini sauce is spread over toasty flatbreads, then topped with tender zucchini, grape tomatoes, pine nuts, cashew “Parmesan,” and a sweet drizzle of agave. A crisp kale salad with dried apricots and sunflower seeds, dressed in a zesty lemon-ginger vinaigrette, makes for a garden-fresh side. </p>
					<h2> Cheesy Broccoli and Potato Soup | $10 </h2>
					<p> This classic American soup is sure to please grown-ups and kids alike! Broccoli, yellow potatoes, and carrots are simmered in a savory, herb-seasoned vegetable broth. It’s all finished with cream cheese and sharp cheddar cheese for rich and creamy flavors. Toasted whole-wheat pita breads add a light crunch on the side.</p>
					<h2> Jamaican Fried Rice <span>Vegan/gluten-free</span> | $13 </h2>
					<p> A takeout classic meets island-inspired flavors in this vegan meal, packed with colorful veggies. Fried long-grain rice (with tamari sauce, pineapple, ginger, and mint) is topped with roasted, jerk-seasoned rainbow carrots and kidney beans. It’s all served over a bed of collard greens tossed in a pineapple-sunflower seed dressing. Cashews add a light crunch over top.</p>
